\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I would like to express gratitude towards my supervisor Dr. Karel Macek for motivating the thesis, constant encouragement and optimism, and for letting me independently shape the thesis topic.

Computational resources were provided by the CESNET LM2015042 and the CERIT Scientific Cloud LM2015085, provided under the programme "Projects of Large Research, Development, and Innovations Infrastructures".

Last but not least, I would like to thank my parents and my grandfather for their continued financial and other support during my delayed studies.
